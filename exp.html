      <p class = "expText">I also participated in the 2024 CS For Good competition with 5 teammates. Our job was to make something that can benefit our community and we won the competition by building a website that could help students all over indiana fullfill diploma requirements. This experience was very helpful for me as I learned a bunch of teamwork skills and worked on something applicable to the real world.</p>
